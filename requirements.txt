# MicroWakeWord-Trainer-Docker specific dependencies
# These are packages assumed to be needed on top of the
# tensorflow/tensorflow:2.19.0-gpu-jupyter base image.

# For audio processing and augmentation
audiomentations==0.39.0 # Updated version, check compatibility
audioread==3.0.1
librosa==0.10.2.post1 # Check if TF base image has a compatible numpy/scipy
soundfile==0.12.1
soxr==0.5.0.post1
webrtcvad==2.0.10 # Often compiled, ensure build-essential covers it

# For data handling and utilities
datasets==3.3.1 # Updated version
dill==0.3.8
filelock==3.16.1
fsspec==2024.12.0 # Check version compatibility with datasets
huggingface-hub==0.27.0 # Check version
mmap_ninja==0.7.4
multiprocess==0.70.16 # For potential parallel processing
pandas==2.2.3 # Base image has 2.2.2, this is a minor update, can align if needed
pooch==1.8.2
pyarrow==18.1.0 # Base image has 17.0.0, this is an update
xxhash==3.5.0

# Note:
# - tensorflow, keras, numpy, scipy, jupyter, ipywidgets, etc., are expected from the base image.
# - audio-metadata: To be handled in the microWakeWord project itself (remove or replace).
# - microwakeword: This will be installed from the local project, not via pip from git here.
# - pymicro-features: This will be installed from the local project or its updated source.
# - NVIDIA packages (nvidia-*) are removed as they are part of the base GPU image.
# - Versions for audiomentations, datasets, etc., are indicative and should be tested for compatibility
#   with Python 3.11 and the base image's core libraries (like numpy, scipy).
